<h2>About Timebomb</h2>
<p>Timebomb was created at the Canberra Global Service Jam in 2012 over the course of three days. 
	It was inspired by the theme for 2012 of "Hidden Treasure".</p>

<p>We explored a lot of ideas about what "Hidden Treasure" might be - and talked about ideas and information as a kind of treasure.
We thought it would be interesting to find a way to hide this treasure away - but build in a way to release the treasure at a later 
time.</p>

<p>This got us thinking about lots of different ways that this could be applied - and really, there are lots of little ways in
	 which you could use a service like this. Let's take a simple story.</p>
<p>A child wants to hide their favourite toy so that it can't be taken by an older brother. They find a secret place, deep in the woods. 
	They dig a hole and carefully bury the toy, stored in a box. They walk home, happy that the toy is safe.</p>
<p>But months pass - and they forget where the toy was buried. They would have written a note, but they were worried the brother would 
	would find it. Where is a safe place where they could record where the toy was hidden?</p>
<p>What if when they hid the toy, they took a photo on their phone, and uploaded it to a safe place? And rather than storing the 
	photo on their phone or computer (where their brother might find it) - they store this secret online in a safe place. The safe 
	place sends them an email with the photo in a couple of months when the danger has passed.</p>
<p>Now, this is a pretty trivial example - but what if the info being stored was more important than just the location of a toy? 
	And what if you could set the release date for the secret to a time far into the future?
	What if the secret was: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Information to bring down a government</li>
	<li>A deep dark family secret, only to be revealed after you die?</li>
	<li>The secret stash of family photos?</h1>
	<li>Your 'insurance policy'? ie - if anything happens to me, damaging info is released to the press.</li>
</ul>

<p>Really - it could be anything that you want to release at a later time. Much like twitter - the benifit comes from the 
wide range of possible uses when it is considered as a platform.</p>

<h3>Value Proposition</h3>
<p>With such a simple idea - the key offering here is to keep it simple, but take care of the unusual elements.</p>
<p>Security is going to be important - so we propose to heavily encrypt all the information added to the system. This goes for both 
	trivial and critical info - hiding needles among needles.</p>
<p>Longevity - some secrets need to remain hidden for a long time. We propose to keep this system running for more than 50 years. If 
	you have a secret in your youth that you want to hide until after your death - it should be able to do that.</p>
<p>A platform for infomation - the same backend system could support a multitude of interfaces each aimed at a different use. ie the 
	use case for a child is different than a journalist protecting sources</p>
<p>Commercial value could be acheived through charging a fee if a secret needs to be stored for more than three months. Given the 
	possible use for activists, journalists, whistleblowers etc - there may also be a possibility of a philanthropic backer.</p>
